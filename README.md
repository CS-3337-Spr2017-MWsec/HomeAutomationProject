Description
A program for our class in which we will imitating a security system of a home in a classroom demonstration. We will be using web cams as if they were house security cams, changing brightness levels on a laptop that will act as lights around the house being able to be turned off and on, and a door locking mechanisms with personalized id cards. We will be creating a web application where the user will have to sign in to, that allows the user to control different parts of the house from a click of the button for each device. They will be able to turn a light off and on , lock front door, view live images of web cams (security cams). We will be using a tangible scan card as an alternative way to open front door, one card is correct and will open it, and the wrong card will trigger a house alarm and proceed to alert authorities. The cards when recognized will ask for the user to say “hello”, and if the systems recognizes the voice, the door will be unlocked, if not the door will remain locked and ask user to scan card again.

-Home security camera concept-

Two laptops will be shown by webcams across classroom, these. This will be demonstrated on application once user signs in from login in screen.

When user signs in they will have an option to turn on and off the porch light when user presses the button an audio will play saying “light on/ lights off. This will be demonstrated by a member's laptop brightness going up or down.

-opening/locking door-

When user signs in they will have the option to lock or unlock front door by the press of a button, when it is pressed an audio will play saying “door open/ door locked” the door on fx animation will light up.  For the card scan demonstration we will scan a correct card and an unrecognized card. The proper card will have the system ask user to say “hello” if voice is recognized the door will open if not the door will remain locked, ask user to scan again.

An additional option is the user opening door with a lock key. We will have two cards one that opens door on that does not , and when the wrong key is used to open door , alarm system will be activated, and voice will say “ intruder, alarming authorities”.

# Design:   

-Appearance-

The application will open with a login screen in which will force the user to log in. From there he will have a cartoon diagram of the house using JavaFX, where parts of the house will light up when they are being used such as lights, cameras, and front door. The user will be able to press a piece of the house and perform a function such as turn off light, look at camera view, and lock front door.
